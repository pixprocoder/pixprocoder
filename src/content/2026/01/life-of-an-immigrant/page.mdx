# Immigration really sucks. No one says that out loud enough. 

People talk about better lives and better opportunities, but they rarely talk about the loss, the fear, and the constant restarting. Still, we move—not because it's easy, but because staying feels harder.

## Always Moving, Never Arriving

I was born in one place, but when I was two years old, my life already began moving. My family relocated to another country, and from that moment on, I was always somewhere in between.



Growing up, I didn't have many chances to explore who I was. I came from a conservative, middle-class family where freedom was limited and hobbies were seen as distractions, not passions worth nurturing. My parents were focused on survival and stability—not dreams. Slowly, I became a girl with no clear ambition, no space to imagine a future that felt like my own.

When I went back to my so-called home country, I felt like a guest. I didn't belong there either. I had no roots, no memories I could fully claim, nothing that felt mine. I realized then that I had spent my whole life moving but never arriving.

## The Canadian Dream That Wasn't

Later, life gave me another opportunity. I came to Canada.


In Canada, I thought life would finally slow down. I thought I would study, build a career, and become someone I had never been allowed to imagine before. But immigration doesn't work that way.

Because of my status, my options were limited. Studying wasn't easy—sometimes not even possible. So I did what many immigrants do: I worked in retail jobs. Honest work, but never the life I dreamed of. I wasn't lazy. I wasn't unmotivated. I was restricted.

In Canada, if you want a good job or a stable career, you need Canadian education or Canadian experience. I had neither. Years passed in survival mode—working, adjusting, repeating. Dreams stayed on pause while life kept moving forward.

## The Grief of Lost Time

By then, I was already a grown woman. When I look around, I see children and teenagers with endless opportunities, support for their talents, and space to explore who they want to be. Sometimes it hurts to realize I never had that chance. My childhood passed in adjustment, not discovery.

Now, after many years, life is finally offering me a chance to study or build something meaningful. But instead of excitement, I feel fear. I feel like it's too late. I tell myself I should focus on making money, supporting my family, and being practical. I shouldn't "waste time" studying—even if the work is hard or unfulfilling, at least it pays.

Now I'm an adult, and everything feels heavier. I have to think about work, career, money, and survival. Responsibility came before self-discovery. I'm trying to build a future without ever having had time to dream properly.

## The Quiet Sacrifice

When I look back, I realize something painful but true: my whole life has been an immigrant life. Always transitioning. Always adjusting. Always moving forward without a place to rest.


Maybe life itself is a transit. We come from somewhere, we stay for a while, and then we move on again. But some of us spend that entire journey searching for a place that finally feels like home.

This is the quiet sacrifice many immigrants make. Sometimes you have to bury your dreams so your family can breathe easier. Sometimes responsibility comes before happiness.

## What Immigration Teaches You

Life as an immigrant teaches you one thing very clearly: nothing is certain. Plans change. Opportunities come late or not at all. And choices are rarely just about you.

I often wish that every child could be born in a place full of opportunity—a place where she never has to regret the life she couldn't choose.

That is my wish.
